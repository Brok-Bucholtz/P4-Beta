# Language Translation
### Introduction
In this project, you’re going to take a peek into the realm of neural network machine translation.  You’ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Submission
Submit the project by April 8th. If you don't finish the project, please submit it anyways.
1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.
2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/826/view).
3. When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the **File** menu in the notebook and choosing "Download as" > HTML. Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together.
4. Package the "dlnd_language_translation.ipynb", "helper.py", "problem_unittests.py", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.
